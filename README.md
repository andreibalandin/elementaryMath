#  Elementary Math

This started as a single view sheet of math problems.
Problems are randomized and maximum of the numbers is controlled by the buttons at the top.
They are implemented as a xib backed by a class and then placed in a collecition view.
I requires student name and current date input before before calculating a score. Then the screenshot is place in the gallery.

Later another game was added. It benefits more from being implemented on a computer, because its scoring is more time consuming.
Navigation controller was added at this time, and name and date fields were moved to the start up screen.
Header, containing complexity control buttons, name and date, and verifycation button, was extracted into a xib. However, this xib is used only on one screen.
